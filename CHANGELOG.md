# Changelog

## 1.1.2 — 2026-04-17

- **Fix (CRITICAL)**: Forge agent template was missing the `tools: ["*"]` frontmatter field. Without it, Forge provisioned the agent with zero tools and any model — no matter how capable — emitted XML/markdown text that looked like tool calls but never executed. `/forge` delegation reported `STATUS: SUCCESS` while no files were actually created. Fixed in `.forge/agents/forge.md` and in the Plan 01-03 template so fresh installs inherit the correct configuration.
- **Fix (BLOCKING)**: Replaced the invalid OpenRouter model ID `qwen/qwen3.6-plus` (which does not exist) with the verified `qwen/qwen3-coder-plus` across README, `skills/forge.md` (8 references), `.forge.toml`, and internal planning artifacts. With the invalid ID set as the active model, the API silently omitted tool schemas, which compounded the Bug 1 symptom. After the fix, `grep -rn "qwen3.6-plus" .` returns only historical audit records.
- **Docs**: README Providers and Models table now shows `Qwen3 Coder Plus` (`qwen/qwen3-coder-plus`) as the recommended default; capability descriptor updated from "vision" to "tool-use" to match the model's actual feature set.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-04-17

- **Fix**: `/forge` activation health check #3 (credentials present) now correctly validates Forge's current credentials schema (`[{id, auth_details}, ...]`). Prior check only matched the legacy flat `{api_key}` schema, causing false-negative activation failures on valid installs. Both schemas now supported; malformed files fail cleanly instead of producing a jq type error.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-04-13

- **Forge delegation mode** (`/forge` skill): explicit activation/deactivation with health check and session state
- **Fallback ladder**: 3-level automatic recovery — L1 Guide (reframe + retry), L2 Handhold (atomic subtask decomposition, max 3 attempts), L3 Take over (Claude acts directly + structured DEBRIEF)
- **Skill injection**: 4 bootstrap skills (testing-strategy, code-review, security, quality-gates) auto-injected based on task type; injection budget enforced (≤2 skills)
- **AGENTS.md mentoring loop**: post-task extraction of corrections, preferences, patterns; 3-tier write (global/project/session log); 2-phase deduplication (exact + semantic)
- **Token optimization**: task prompts capped at 2,000 tokens; validated `.forge.toml` compaction defaults (token_threshold=80000, eviction_window=0.20, retention_window=6, max_tokens=16384)
- **Help Center** (`docs/help/`): 5-page static documentation site with search, dark/light theme, covering Getting Started, Core Concepts, Delegation Workflow, Command Reference, and Troubleshooting
- **Test suite**: 8 automated test suites, 70 assertions covering all Phase 1-4 additions
